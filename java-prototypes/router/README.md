## ðŸ”— From Go Router to Spring Boot (Proof of Concept)

### Why this matters for your Java Trainee program:
| My Go Router (2024) | Java Translation | Your Benefit |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| `func handleRoute(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` | `@GetMapping("/route") public String routeRequest(...)` | **Zero learning curve** for routing logic |
| Manual service discovery | Spring Cloud Gateway (future step) | Ready for enterprise from day 1 |

### Critical insight for recruiters:
This is **not a "Hello World"** â€” it's a **direct port** of my Go experience to Spring.  
When you teach me Spring Cloud, I won't learn concepts â€” I'll **implement them immediately** because:  
â†’ I already built the pattern in Go  
â†’ I know *why* Spring automates it
