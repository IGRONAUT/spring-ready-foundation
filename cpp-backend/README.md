## 🔗 How this relates to Spring Boot

| My C++ code                      | Spring Boot equivalent                  |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `if (request_method == "POST")`  | `@PostMapping("/products")`             |
| `ShopDB.find_product_by_model()` | `ProductRepository.findByModel()`       |
| `urlDecode()` function           | Automatic processing of `@RequestParam` |
| Manual HTML generation           | `@RestController` + `@ResponseBody`     |

> 💡 **Why this is important**:  
> I have already implemented the logic that Spring automates.  
> Learning Spring is not about “learning from scratch,” but rather **transferring existing experience to a new stack**.

### ⚡ **Critical insight for recruiters**
This CGI project **isn't just a university lab** — it's a **production-ready pattern** I built *before knowing Spring exists*.  
When you teach me Spring Boot, I won't be learning concepts — I'll be **translating proven solutions** into your stack.  
*Example:*  
- My manual `urlDecode()` → You show me `@RequestParam` → I implement it **immediately** (no theory needed).  
- My SQLite CRUD → You show me Spring Data JPA → I ship features **in 2 days, not 2 weeks**.
