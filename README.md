## ðŸ”— Why this matters for your Java Trainee program
| Your requirement    | My proof                                              | How it connects to Spring                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Java Core / OOP** | 1 year self-study + C++ projects                      | My CGI-backend used pure ÐžÐžÐŸ (Product/Category classes) â†’ perfect base for Spring beans |
| **SQL / DB**        | SQLite CRUD in C++ (`ShopDB.find_product_by_model()`) | Spring Data JPA = automation of my manual SQL logic                                     |
| **Microservices**   | 3 Go services (router, weather API, Authentication)   | Direct prep for Spring Cloud (my router = API Gateway prototype)                        |
| **DevOps**          | Docker/microk8s in course project                     | Enterprise-ready infrastructure skills (FinTech critical!)                              |

## ðŸš€ My flagship project: C++ CGI â†’ Spring Boot prototype
```cpp
// In my code (main.cpp, line 45):
if (option == 7) { /* Adding a product */ }
```
```java
// What it will look like in Spring Boot:
@PostMapping("/products")
public void addProduct(@RequestBody ProductDTO dto) { ... }
```
> ðŸ’¡ **Why recruiters should care**:  
> Iâ€™ve already built what Spring automates â€” Iâ€™ll master it **3x faster** than typical juniors.
